        "reviewDescription": "Just that.  I remember the days of the department stores and sifting through oddly shaped and sized store racks for sizes that probably didn't exist and you got whatever colors you could find.  I don't know why department stores thought shapewear should be on those tiny hangers and store racks.Thank goodness for the internet.While there is the issue of sizing, that can usually be figured out with a good measuring tape and size chart.I order a size down for shapewear. It's stretchy and I like the slimmer lines. If you do historical costumes then it fits under the costume like a corset.  Also living in Texas, you have to mitigate your layers with the Texas heat.  If you dress up for anachronism as a job, or on a regular basis, this body suit is still good for waist training. For you, probably get 4 or 5 and wash after each wear to get used to the steady compression of a corset.  Then you can layer the corset over it and the stretchy material gives a layer of protection to your skin and the corset.  If you're a weekender going to a convention or Renaissance festival maybe once or twice a year, this bodysuit is perfect.  The metric is \"Can you eat, drink, sit, and toilet in it comfortably\".  Comfort is so important in all things fashion. Confidence comes out of that comfort. Not trying to say that weekenders shouldn't enjoy wearing a corset, but this bodysuit is a great facsimile if the idea of a corset seems too daunting.The bottom line is if you're going to be wearing shapewear regularly, buy it like you would regular underwear as in 5 at a time. Wash it after each wear to maintain the elastic.  The bodysuit doesn't ride up, the crotch is a reasonable size, with no unfortunate seam up the clam crack. Getting into it or out of it isn't difficult.  The hook and eye closures don't land in an awkward place.Definitely cosplay friendly",

        "reviewDescription": "I don't like shapewear lol. I have worn the ones that are sort of like bike shorts but with more tummy coverage a few times for certain events or outfits and they always pinched and would ride down at the waist, but the shorts would also somehow ride up, I was always super sweaty in them and uncomfortable, they would pinch - it was just an all around bad time. So several years ago, I threw in the towel and just decided I would not deal with it anymore lol. I would wear regular bike shorts under dresses or skirts and otherwise it would be fine.And then I got invited to a fancier event for NYE. And I had a dress to wear already in my closet. But it *needed* shapewear to look how I wanted it to. I went on an Amazon hunt and after many hours of searching and reading reviews - I landed on this one. I got the full body shaper that basically looks like a leotard with shorts lol. I sort of snickered at the idea that I could wear this without a bra - I am a DDD, I didn't even try it without a bra on NYE, just pulled this on right over the bra I was wearing - which worked no problem.The wonderful thing about this shaper is that it actually works how it should. It doesn't ride up or down, it doesn't bunch, it is breathable enough that I don't feel like I am dying - and it smooths everything out and provides protection from chub rub. The shorts are short enough for cocktail dresses - and it is easy enough to pull them shorter if need be and adjust the shaper accordingly. I danced the night away, and drank way too much at the after-after party in this shaper lol. And didn't feel uncomfortable once.Now, the fun part - I decided to try wearing this to go out with the girls a few weekends ago with some jeans and a vest that I have always wanted to wear as a shirt - but never felt I could get away with it with my chest. This shaper *actually* worked with my chest. Was it as supportive as a \"proper\" bra with an underwire? No. Was it more supportive than a bralette? Hell yeah - seriously *so* much better than a bralette. No sagging or weird uni-boob! I loved the amount of support it gave me actually. it looked great with jeans and my vest-as-a-shirt also, but I was so jazzed about how genuinely comfortable I was in it which I never would have actually believed was possible for a bodyshaper.Since then, I have worn it at least 3 other times, to work, or to go out with friends. I've worn it to dinner and had a full meal with no issues, I have sat in the office all day in it and not been uncomfortable. And it gives me such a nice level of support without being restrictive at all. I move around a lot lol - and this doesn't impact me at all. I literally have sometimes forgotten I had it on until I went to use the restroom lol.The only *tiny* thing that I haven't 100% loved about it - is that the bust line is a little high (especially if you are tightening the straps to get as much support as you can lol) so the shaper sometimes would peep out the top of my shirt a bit which I would have liked if it was low enough that didn't happen and so I could get some proper cleavage lol. But overall I adore it and will probably see if there are other necklines by this brand to try out.",

I had absolutely no challenges getting this on ( makes me wonder if I need a smaller size). Now the pros you can see in the pic, it smooths our the \u201clumps\u201d what I removed a star was for the strap marking on my shoulders and the back (thong) lining is visible through clothing. Also it is a little to long for my body.. although you can adjust the straps up top\u2026 I feel like I need to make it smaller /shorter by pulling down below\u2026 Otherwise, the top portion of the bodysuit becomes more visible under your top as I gets closer to your neck line. Because it\u2019s a little bit longer I do feel more pressure on my waist line where the extra material crinkles up. I wore this for approx 8 hours and besides straps, all was comfortableI would prefer black, so I may purchase the shorts version in black.Overall, I\u2019m glad I purchased, I can get past the issues.",

This shaper is not going to make you skinny however, it will hide any rolls you have,flatten them out for you and make your body not look so lumpy which is great and make you feel a lot better when going out. I would not recommend going out drinking (which I do every time I wear it) but if you do, just plan on being in the bathroom and extra 5 minutes. The strap at the crotch is the same strap that is on our typical bras so it takes a minute to get it on and off.... Especially the more you drink. The shaper has no breast pads so I just slid a couple from my other bras in there. It's definitely worth the buy because it will make you look and feel better. It is very stretchy so it is kind of hard to order the wrong size. I am 5'2 167 lb and I ordered a small.",

It really pulls me in and lets me hide my 30 something mom fupa when I'm around my young 20 something co-workers. Because I've had a child, I've got them birthing hips. If I was letting this body suit hit where it wanted to I'd cut my love handles in half and it would inevitably roll up. I let the bikini cut of this pull up above my meat handles and it looks like I'm snatched in all the ways I want to be. I followed the advice and sized down, usually I'm a large but because I was looking for compression I got a medium and it was perfect.Oh, and the boobs. Unless you got silicone in them boobies to combat the compression, you're going to look flat but nips a-blazing. I wear a bra underneath and notice that I still don't have my normal full bust. My full C goes to an A, know what I mean?All in all, would buy again, will buy again in black.",

So hindsight is 20/20 and I cannot  return it due to that it is obviously used after minimum wear, and I cannot order a larger one because the high price broke my budget for sexy clothing in the near future.

I\u2019ve never purchased or worn shapewear before, so I really didn\u2019t know what to look for. I\u2019m satisfied with this product, it fit and functioned as advertised. It smoothed out my curves and keeps my tummy tight. The material, while soft and supple against the skin, is pretty thin and borderline flimsy. I expect to get 3-5 good wears out of this before it becomes non-functional.",

The only thing that would make it better would be if there was padding in the cups.  I bought this to wear under a bridesmaid dress but I might wear it even more!  It does have a cut out for peeing, not sure how that will work.  For reference I am 5'4\", about 180lbs, 38 bust, 33 waist, 42 hips and I got the medium for a snug and supportive fit.",

This will look TINY when it comes out of the package but trust the process bc it\u2019s stretchy lol. The beige matched my skin tone pretty well too.  Only con I have for this is the chest area. I am a 42DD and this gave me the dreaded smooshed uni-boob similar to a strong sports bra.  Doesn\u2019t shape the melons in the least bit.

A big issues for many might be the hip area that rides up and can leave you with weird indentations in your hip/rear area. It did not bother me but I could see how on others it would be a deal breaker. I honestly would give this 5 stars but it got a snag on it the second time I wore it.",

I have a short waist (5 foot 1) and 179 lbs so I did order the L/XL and it fit well. Adjustable bra straps held up the garment and kept it in place for 10 hour day. Over all comfort 7/10 for something with this much compression.Negatives: I am short waisted so the thong portion came up my back a bit and sort of rolled at the top of each hip/booty cheek. Had to be adjusted during the day. Bra was not lined so to hide nipples either use a bra insert or wear normal bra under this, it is stretchy enough for either. Crotch was awkward to clip back together in restroom, thong was a tad uncomfortable due to the wideness of the band that goes between butt cheeks. Shoulder straps a bit cheap so they dug in.Over all good price for compression garment compared to higher priced brand names. If you have a mommy tummy and want something to help suck it back in under dresses and slacks try this one. Worth the price.",

It does not make your stomach completely flat if you\u2019re or a little bit overweight, but it does smooth it out and not make you look. So bloated. So far it does appear to be very comfortable.",

However, I can sew so it was easier to repair it myself than to go thru the hoopla of returning & getting a replacement.It was super tiny right out of the package so I did not think it would fit BUT it went on without any struggle whatsoever and has a very comfortable smoothing effect.. seemed to even out my tummy nicely and somehow made my backside more shapely/rounded as well. I did notice the hips rolled up when I had panties on underneath but without them it seemed to grip my skin a little better. Might be an issue for fitted dresses but jeans/pants should hold it in place.Overall, it\u2019s probably 1 of the best pieces of shapewear I own & I own A LOT! lol I think I\u2019ll grab another in nude as well. For reference, my measurements are 40D, 33W, 48H. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d tall, curvy, & 230lbs. I purchased an XL/XXL & it fit perfectly.",

It\u2019s not bad if you pull it down, but it can get irritating. also if you have a fatter coochie (\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) you have to pull it down too. when i saw the reviews i saw people wearing it so that the sides go above your hips, but i am wearing mine so it stops right at the hips. covers my bits and gives that smooth look. Other than that, i really like this. I sized down also. For reference i\u2019m 5\u20193 and 180lbs. i got the sm/med.",

It is providing me with motivation to lose a little more weight for it to fit better. It looks great otherwise, and the hooks at the crotch are nice and stretchy and easy to hook. There is also enough stretch to just pull the crotch to the side when doing your business, and the hooks don\u2019t come undone when you don\u2019t want them to. I wish ShaperX would come up with a gusset that doesn\u2019t unhook, as I rarely use that feature, and would much prefer something more comfortable and covering in the gusset area.
